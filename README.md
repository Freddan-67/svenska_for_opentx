Swedish sound files for opentx 2.3

Currently one sound is missing for the system folder.
The sounds are created with a tool called "TTSAutomate".
You will need the Wave files, so make sure to go to settings and select "Encode MP3 to WAV"
Select output directory
Select Astrid, Swedish, Female
Select Go!

There is supposed to be 274 files, I managed to find 273 only, so one file is missing from the SYSTEM directory
